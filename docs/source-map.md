# Source Map

Provenance for the `triz-innovation` skill. Everything in `references/` is
**original operational rewriting** — checklists, procedures, decision tables. No
long passages were copied from the books; the books were used as conceptual
cross-checks only.

## Repo used: `triz-prompt-engineering-main`
Structured TRIZ prompts (XML) by the ccTOPP / TRIZ-prompt-engineering project (MIT
licensed). Files consulted and what was distilled from each:

| `technical_triz/physical_contradictions/Physical Contradictions and Separation Principles Prompt.xml` | physical contradiction form + 4 separations → `physical-contradictions.md` |
| `technical_triz/resource_analysis/*` (+ Derivative Resources) | 6 resource types, derived resources → `resource-analysis.md` |

| `technical_triz/trimming_and_trimming_rules/trimming_rules.xml` | trimming rules A/B/C + guidelines 1–4 → `trimming.md` |
| `technical_triz/system_operator/system_operator.xml` | 9 Windows grid → `system-operator.md` |
| `technical_triz/smart_little_people/*` | SLP method → `triz-method-map.md` |

## Books used (conceptual reference only — `Books/`)
| File | What it is | How it informed the skill |
|---|---|---|
| `6549f8e87f614ecaba659cae5c4b64e1_md_full.md` | **Simplified TRIZ, 3rd ed.** (technical + business) | Most-used conceptual cross-check: practical framing of function analysis, ideality, and business application; "separate the best from the rest" → evaluation stage |
| `Deep Dive into TRIZ — Engineering Problem Solving Algorithm …` | best practices / optimization for running TRIZ projects | informed the disciplined pipeline ordering and "always end with an experiment" stance |
| `078e1e0d148541c58692901e94907f3c_md_full.md` | TRIZ Engineering Problem-Solving Algorithm — tips & tricks / project mgmt | common mistakes, low-priority-task tips → operating rules ("don't skip a stage", method-over-inspiration) |
| `6dfcc1cb… ` + `World Conference of AI-Powered Innovation and TRIZ Methodology 2nd IFIP WG 5.md` | IFIP conference proceedings on AI-powered TRIZ | direction for future MCP/LLM integration; confirmed LLM-assisted FOS/MOS framing |
| `TRIZ-Anwendertag 2020 (Oliver Mayer)` | German TRIZ conference proceedings | spot conceptual cross-check only; not deeply mined (German) |

## Concepts extracted (turned into operational notes)
Function modeling (T/A/O, U/H, N/I/E) · cause-effect chains & leverage points ·
engineering vs physical contradictions · the 4 separation principles · 40
inventive principles (with soft/business/software readings) · 6+ resource types &
derived resources · ideality equation & IFR · trimming rules A/B/C · 9 Windows ·
FOS/MOS · domain adaptations (business, software, rehab).

## Limits / not yet analyzed
- The full **contradiction matrix** is not embedded in the skill; `contradiction-analysis.md` points to the repo CSVs to load on demand (keeps the skill light).
- **76 Standard Solutions** is referenced but not expanded into its own note (only the EN/DE markdown in the repo). Candidate for a future `references/standard-solutions.md`.
- German-language sources (`TRIZ-Anwendertag 2020`, DE markdowns) were skimmed, not deeply mined.
- PDFs/XLSX in the repo (`ISQ++`, `prompt-format-guide.pdf`) were not parsed.
- No book text was copied; if a future version wants verbatim definitions, check licensing per book first.
