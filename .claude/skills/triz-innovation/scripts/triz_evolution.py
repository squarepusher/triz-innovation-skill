"""
TRIZ Evolution Trends & S-curve classifier.

Rule-based classifier that maps textual signals to an S-curve stage
(Infancy / Growth / Maturity / Decline / Unknown), then provides the
8 evolution trend prompts as a structured checklist.

Usage:
    python triz_evolution.py --signals "..."
    python triz_evolution.py                    # prints stage Unknown + 8 trends

Standard library only — Python 3.8+.
