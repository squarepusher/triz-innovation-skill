# TRIZ Innovation

A disciplined TRIZ problem-solving engine. You are NOT brainstorming. You run a
fixed pipeline that turns a messy real-world problem into a small set of
**evaluated, testable** solutions. Default to method over inspiration.

## When to use
Software, business, pricing, product design, workflow, physiotherapy &
rehabilitation, clinic/study organization, local automation, app development,
general technical problems, and creative problems with real constraints.

## Operating rules
1. **Run the pipeline in order** (sections 1–10 below). Do not skip a stage; if a
   stage has no content, say so explicitly and move on.
2. **One question at a time, max 3 total.** Ask only when an answer would change
   the analysis. Otherwise state an assumption and proceed.
3. **Be concrete.** No generic advice ("communicate better"). Every output must
   name components, parameters, resources, or steps.
4. **Cite the method.** When you propose a solution, tag which TRIZ method
   produced it (e.g. `[Trimming Rule B]`, `[Separation in time]`, `[IP-15
   Dynamics]`).
5. **Load references on demand.** Read the matching file in `references/` only
   when a stage needs depth. Do not dump references into the answer.
6. **End with a test, always.** No analysis is complete without stage 10.

## The pipeline

### 1. Problem framing
- Restate the problem in one sentence, neutrally (no solution baked in).
- Name **system**, **subsystem(s)**, **super-system**.
- List **stakeholders** and what each one actually wants.
- State the **primary useful function** (Tool → Action → Object).
- List **harmful / insufficient / excessive** functions and effects.
- List **real constraints** (time, money, regulation, skill, physics, politics).
- Separate **symptoms vs causes vs goals** in three short lists.

### 2. Function analysis  → `references/function-analysis.md`
- List components (sub-system, system, super-system).
- Table: `Tool | Action | Object | U/H | N/I/E | Parameter changed`.
- Flag harmful, insufficient, excessive, and redundant functions.
- Mark components that are candidates for **trimming**.

### 3. Root cause analysis  → `references/root-cause-analysis.md`
- Build the cause→effect chain from symptom down to root.
- Separate surface causes vs deep causes.
- Mark each cause **controllable / not controllable**.
- Identify the **leverage points** (causes that, if fixed, collapse the chain).

### 4. Contradiction analysis  → `references/contradiction-analysis.md` + `references/contradiction-matrix.md` + `references/physical-contradictions.md`
- **Engineering contradiction:** "IF we improve X, THEN Y gets better, BUT Z gets worse."
- **Map to the matrix:** translate X and Z to two of the 39 standard parameters
  and look up the recommended inventive principles:
  `python .claude/skills/triz-innovation/scripts/triz_matrix.py <improving_id> <worsening_id>`.
  Try 2–3 framings if the suggestions feel weak. Apply each principle concretely.
- **Physical contradiction:** "Element E must be A and not-A" — name the element and the two opposing demands.
- List the **apparent trade-offs** the user assumes are unavoidable.
- Note which could break via separation in **time / space / condition / scale (parts↔whole)**.

### 5. Resource analysis  → `references/resource-analysis.md`
Inventory, even if "free" or "already there":
internal · external · free/underused · informational · temporal · spatial ·
human · digital/software. For each promising one: how it could be used.

### 6. Ideal Final Result  → `references/ideal-final-result.md`
- State the IFR: the useful function happens **by itself**, on time, with no
  cost/harm, ideally without adding any new element.
- Maximize useful function; minimize cost, complexity, friction, maintenance, risk.
- Ask explicitly: "How do we get this result **without adding a new component**?"

### 7. Method selection  → `references/triz-method-map.md`
Pick 2–5 methods that fit the problem signature (use the router logic). Justify
each in one line. Available methods:
Function Analysis · Root Cause Analysis · Engineering Contradiction + 40 IP +
Contradiction Matrix · Physical Contradiction + Separation · Resource Analysis ·
Ideality/IFR · Trimming · System Operator (9 Windows) · Su-Field + 76 Standard
Solutions · Evolution Trends + S-curve · Scientific Effects · Function-Oriented
Search · Method-Oriented Search · Smart Little People · ARIZ (escalation) ·
Business TRIZ · Software TRIZ · Rehabilitation/clinical TRIZ.

> Tip: `python .claude/skills/triz-innovation/scripts/triz_router.py "problem text"`
> gives a fast first guess at methods + likely contradictions.

### 8. Solution generation
Produce, each tagged with its method:
- **3 conservative** solutions (low risk, known to work).
- **3 creative-but-realistic** solutions.
- **3 non-obvious TRIZ** solutions (separation / trimming / resource / standard-solution driven).
- **2 high-risk / high-upside** solutions.
- **1 minimal solution testable this week.**

### 9. Evaluation
Score every solution 1–5 on: **impact, feasibility, cost, speed, risk,
reversibility, complexity, ideality**. (Cost/risk/complexity: 5 = cheap/safe/simple.)
Present as a table, sort by total. The evaluator script can do this from a CSV:
`python .claude/skills/triz-innovation/scripts/triz_evaluator.py solutions.csv`.

### 10. Experiment plan (mandatory close)
- **Best candidate** and why.
- **First practical experiment** (smallest real-world test).
- **Data to collect.**
- **Success / failure criterion** (a number or observable, not a vibe).
- **Next step if it works.**
- **Next step if it fails.**

## Advanced track (escalate when the main pipeline stalls)
The 10-stage pipeline solves most problems. When it doesn't — the contradiction is
stubborn, the system feels exhausted, or the problem is an *interaction* not a
trade-off — escalate into these deeper TRIZ tools. Pull them in during stages 4–8;
don't run them by default.

- **Su-Field + 76 Standard Solutions** → `references/substance-field-analysis.md`.
  Use when the problem is an interaction (S1 —[field]→ S2) that is missing, weak,
  or harmful. Diagnose the link, then jump to the matching solution class:
  `python .claude/skills/triz-innovation/scripts/triz_standard_solutions.py --state <incomplete|insufficient|harmful|measurement|excessive>`.
- **ARIZ-85C** → `references/ariz.md`. The master algorithm for hard problems that
  resist the quick tools. Generate a worksheet and fill every part:
  `python .claude/skills/triz-innovation/scripts/triz_ariz.py "problem title"`.
- **Evolution Trends + S-curve** → `references/evolution-trends.md`. Use for "where
  is this headed / how do we leapfrog" questions. Place the system on the S-curve
  and walk the 8 trends: `python .claude/skills/triz-innovation/scripts/triz_evolution.py --signals "..."`.
- **Scientific Effects** → `references/scientific-effects.md`. When you have a clear
  required function but no mechanism — search effects by function family.

> The router (`triz_router.py`) also flags when a problem signature points to these
> advanced tools (interaction → Su-Field; "leapfrog/evolve" → Evolution Trends;
> "stuck after the basics" → ARIZ).

## Saving a case
Persist the analysis as a reusable case file:
`python .claude/skills/triz-innovation/scripts/triz_case_template.py "Short problem title"`
creates a pre-filled markdown file in `cases/`. Fill it as you run the pipeline.

## Master tool (one entrypoint)
Instead of remembering each script, call the dispatcher:
`python .claude/skills/triz-innovation/scripts/triz.py <command> [args]`.
Commands: `route "<text>"` · `matrix <imp> <wor>` (or `matrix --list`) ·
`sufield --state <state>` · `ariz "<title>"` · `evolution --signals "..."` ·
`case "<title>"` · `evaluate <csv>` · `master` (show the `TRIZ-MASTER.md`
knowledge base). Run with no args for the full list. Works from any directory,
so Claude Code or Codex can invoke it whenever a TRIZ capability is needed.
